## Balancing screen time with play

- Use a visual timer in Arabic or English so your child sees when screen time ends.
- Offer an engaging alternative before the screen switches off, such as building blocks or drawing their favorite character.
- Keep screens out of the bedroom to protect sleep hygiene.
- Share one daily program together and discuss the story in Arabic to reinforce language skills.
